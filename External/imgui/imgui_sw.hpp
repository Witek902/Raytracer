// WHAT:
//   This is a software renderer for Dear ImGui.
//   It is decently fast, but has a lot of room for optimization.
//   The goal was to get something fast and decently accurate in not too many lines of code.
// LIMITATIONS:
//   * It is not pixel-perfect, but it is good enough for must use cases.
//   * It does not support painting with any other texture than the default font texture.
